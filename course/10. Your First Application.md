# 10. Your First Application

Today is the big day, you will make your first application! :v:

An application needs a point of entry, where everything starts at the time you launch the application. In Scala the point of entry is a function named `main` that takes an `Array` of `String` and returns `Unit`. This function needs to be in an `object`:
```scala
object MyApplication {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val result = 2 + 3
  }
}
```

> :raising_hand: What is this parameter `args: Array[String]`?

`Array` is a type of collection just like `Seq` but has some different performance properties. And this parameter `args` is used to pass some parameter arguments when you start your application.  
I will not explain further this parameter because we will not use it in this chapter but we need to have it in the definition of the function to make the application work.,  

> :raising_hand: Why `main` is returning a `Unit`? Shouldn't we return `Int`?

As I said a `main` needs to return a `Unit`.  
Remember the type `Unit` is a special type you can understand as a **Unit of calculation that returns no value**.
So `main` is a Unit of calculation that returns no value. It computes `2 + 3` and store the result in a `val` but it doesn't return anything, not even `result`.

Let's run this application:  
Make sure you put `MyApplication` in `MyApplication.scala` file in your project folder and in the command prompt run `sbt run`:
```console
C:\Users\Joan\Documents\ScalaCourse> sbt run
[info] Set current project to scalacourse (in build file:/C:/Users/Joan/Documents/ScalaCourse/)
[info] Compiling 1 Scala source to D:\ScalaCourse\target\scala-2.10\classes...
[info] Running MyApplication
[success] Total time: 1 s, completed 13-Feb-2016 12:58:43
C:\Users\Joan\Documents\ScalaCourse>
```
SBT tells you that it compiles 1 Scala source (file) and then that it's running MyApplication.

> :raising_hand: That's it? Why I don't see anything on the screen?

Because you've done nothing out of calculating `2 + 3` and storing it in `result`!

You want to display something on the screen? You can use a provided function called `println` that takes a `String` and return `Unit`.   
So here is what you need:
```scala
object MyApplication {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println("Hello world!")
  }
}
```
```console
C:\Users\Joan\Documents\ScalaCourse> sbt run
[info] Set current project to scalacourse (in build file:/C:/Users/Joan/Documents/ScalaCourse/)
[info] Compiling 1 Scala source to D:\ScalaCourse\target\scala-2.10\classes...
[info] Running MyApplication
Hello world!
[success] Total time: 1 s, completed 13-Feb-2016 13:01:34
C:\Users\Joan\Documents\ScalaCourse>
```
Here is an other example of a function that returns `Unit`. When called, `println` takes your `String` displays it and returns no value, in Scala words it returns `Unit`.


## Packaging your application with SBT

You know how to run an application with SBT but it would be good if we could be able to distribute your application to your users, so that they can run your application too!  
To package your application we will need an SBT plugin called "**SBT assembly**".

Create a folder called `project` in your project folder and create a file called `plugins.sbt` in this new folder and paste this line in it:
```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.eed3si9n" % "sbt-assembly" % "0.14.4")
```
* `addSbtPlugin` tells SBT to add a plugin. 
* `"com.eed3si9n"` is the **identifier** of the person or company that created the plugin.
* `"sbt-assembly"` is the **name** of the plugin.
* `"0.14.4"` is the **version** of the plugin we want.

That's it you've added the new plugin **SBT assembly**.

Now we can use the command `sbt assembly` and it will package your application:
```console
C:\Users\Joan\Documents\ScalaCourse> sbt assembly

> :information_source: You can see lots of `downloading...` the first time because it is downloading the plugin the first time.

SBT tells us that it has been packaged in `C:\Users\Joan\ScalaCourse\target\scala-2.10\scalacourse-assembly-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`.  
`scalacourse-assembly-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` is the file that represents your application, you can double-click on it to run the application.

> :raising_hand: I tried to double-click on it like you said and nothing appeared! Why?

Because we havn't made any interface and the console is not displayed.  
So you can run the application in command line by typing `cmd` in the address bar, then in the command prompt `java -jar scalacourse-assembly-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`:
```console
C:\Users\Joan\Documents\ScalaCourse\target\scala-2.10> java -jar scalacourse-assembly-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
Hello world!
C:\Users\Joan\Documents\ScalaCourse\target\scala-2.10>
```
* `java` is the command to run the **JVM**.
* `-jar` is the flag to tell that we are giving a jar file as there is other ways to launch an application on the JVM.
* `scalacourse-assembly-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` is your application.

There you go, you are now officially a software developer ready to build the next Google company! :wink:
