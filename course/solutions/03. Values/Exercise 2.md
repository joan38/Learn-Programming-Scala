```scala
scala> val coursePrice = 10000
coursePrice: Int = 10000

scala> val negotiatedCoursePrice = coursePrice * (1 - 0.30)
negotiatedCoursePrice: Double = 7000.0

scala> val negotiatedCoursePriceTaxIncluded = negotiatedCoursePrice * (1 + 0.20)
negotiatedCoursePriceTaxIncluded: Double = 8400.0
```
It will cost you Â£8400 :laughing:.
