# 5. Blocks Of Code

I think it's now time to learn how to make blocks of code. A **block of code** in a set of expressions put in curly brackets.  
Here is an example:
```scala
scala> {
     |   3 + 6
     |   var varBlock = "a var declared in a block can't be seen outside of the block"
     |   'A'
     | }
<console>:9: warning: a pure expression does nothing in statement position; you may be omitting necessary parentheses
                3 + 6
                  ^
res0: Char = A
```
Multiple things to say here:
* When a curly bracket is opened you can notice that the console let's you write multiple lines. That's good because it would be difficult to make blocks of code otherwise!
* The whole **block is an expression** that gets evaluated line by line until the last line, and the **result of the last line is the result of the block**.
* The **type** returned by the block is the type of the value returned by **the last line**.
* The variable `varBlock` declared in a block **can't be seen outside of the block**. It is the case for `val` too and anything declared in a block.
* As you can see, we usually make an indentation of **2 spaces** inside a block for the ease of reading. This is not mandatory but a convention between Scala developers.

> :raising_hand: In your example the 2 first statements are useless and only the last one is used for the evaluation of the block, that will always return the character 'A' no matter what are the 2 first statements. Why did you write that?

Yes indeed, that's what the warning tells us. In other words this example is bit stupid :trollface: but it shows it.  
Let's do another example less stupid then:
```scala
scala> val priceTaxIncluded = {
     |   val coursePrice = 5
     |   val taxRate = 0.20
     |   coursePrice * (1 + taxRate)
     | }
priceTaxIncluded: Double = 6.0
```
And yes we can assign the result of a block to a `val` or a `var`

We can put blocks of code everywhere in Scala, in `val`, `var`, `if` and more in the next chapters.  
Here is an example where we calculate the price of the course according to the country, tax rate, currency and the way we display the currency can differ:
```scala
scala> val coursePrice = 5
coursePrice: Int = 5

scala> val country = "UK"
country: String = "UK"

scala> if (country == "UK") {
     |   val taxRate = 0.20
     |   val currency = "£"
     |   currency + coursePrice * (1 + taxRate)
     | } else if (country == "Greece") {
     |   val taxRate = 0.23
     |   val currency = "€"
     |   coursePrice * (1 + taxRate) + currency
     | } else "Unknown country"
res1: String = "£6.0"
```

We are starting to have quiet big blocks of code!

We can have blocks inside blocks:
```scala
scala> {
     |   val coursePrice = 5
     |   val taxRate = 0.50
     |   val resultSubBlock = {
     |     val taxRate = 0.20
     |     coursePrice * taxRate
     |   }
     |   val resultBlock = coursePrice * taxRate
     |   "Block result: " + resultBlock + ", Subblock result: " + resultSubBlock
     | }
res2: String = Block result: 2.5, Subblock result: 1.0
```
You can see that when there is 2 values with the same name, one in a block and one in a subblock, a call to this value will reach the closest one.
In this example `taxRate` is declared in the 2 blocks, 1st in the block to `0.50` and then in the subblock to `0.20`.  
* The first computation of `coursePrice * taxRate` (that is in the subblock) is taking `0.20` for `taxRate` as it's defined in the same subblock.  
* The second computation of `coursePrice * taxRate` (that is in the block) is taking `0.50` for `taxRate` as it's defined in the same block. And you can see that the statement `val taxRate = 0.20` didn't override the first declaration of `taxRate` to `0.50`, as it was delared and available only in the subblock.

> :raising_hand: Ok but why the call to `coursePrice` in the subblock is working? I can't see it declared in the subblock!

As I said, a call to a value will reach the closest one, in this example it can't find `coursePrice` in the subblock, so it goes outside in the parent block.

A value is not accessible outside of the blocks it's in:
```scala
scala> {
     |   {
     |     val a = "I'm a"
     |   }
     |   a + "and I'm not that accesible"
     | }
<console>:8: warning: a pure expression does nothing in statement position; you may be omitting necessary parentheses
              {
              ^
<console>:12: error: not found: value a
               a + "and I'm not that accesible"
               ^
```

And in a simple block, like outside of a block, we can't call a value that is defined after. In other words, we can call only values defined before:
```scala
scala> {
     |   val result = a + "and I'm not that accesible"
     |   val a = "I'm a"
     |   result
     | }
<console>:12: error: not found: value a
               a + "and I'm not that accesible"
               ^
```

## Comments

We can add comments directly in the middle of the code. There is 2 type of comments: 
* The **simple line** comments that is written:
  ```scala
  // My simple line comment
  ```
  
  Everything that is after `//` is ignored by the compiler.
* The **multi lines** or **part line** comments that is written:
  ```scala
  /* My multi line comment
     is actually multi cool */
  ```
  
  or:
  ```scala
  val /* We are very */ taxRate /* annoying */ = /* part line comments */ 0.50
  ```
  
  Everything that is between `/*` and `*/` is ignored by the compiler.

So let's rewind the course and try again with comments :rewind::  
We can have blocks inside blocks:
```scala
scala> {
     |   /* This example shows the different scopes 
     |      we have with blocks. */
     |   val coursePrice = 5
     |   val taxRate = 0.50
     |   val resultSubBlock = {
     |     val taxRate = 0.20
     |     coursePrice * taxRate // taxRate will be 0.20
     |   }
     |   val resultBlock = coursePrice * taxRate  // taxRate will be 0.50
     |   "Block result: " + resultBlock + ", Subblock result: " + resultSubBlock
     | }
res2: String = Block result: 2.5, Subblock result: 1.0
```
