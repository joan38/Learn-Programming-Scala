### The function `map`
It is possible to apply a function on every elements of a collection:  
So let's define a function that doubles a number:
```scala
scala> def double(i: Int) = i * 2
double: (i: Int)Int
```

Now we can apply that function on all elements of the collection with `map`:
```scala
scala> numbers.map(double)
res3: Array[Int] = Array(2, 10, 6)
```
There you go! All numbers doubled.

> How does it works?

So basically each element of the collection will be passed to double and be replaced by the result of what double returns.  
Here is what is happening step by step:

1. `1` comes as a first element and gets given to the function `double` which returns `2`. 
2. `5` comes and gets given to the function `double` which returns `10`.
3. `3` comes and gets given to the function `double` which returns `6`.
4. `map` returns a new `Array` of `Int` that contains the new elements returned by `double`.

As I showed you before in the [Higher Order Functions](06.%20Functions.md#higher-order-functions) an **anonymous function** can be directly given to `map`:
```scala
scala> numbers.map((i: Int) => i * 2)
res4: Array[Int] = Array(2, 10, 6)
```
So basically each element of the collection will come in as `i` and be replaced by the result of what is after the `=>`.

It also works with multiple lines **anonymous function**:
```scala
scala> numbers.map { (i: Int) =>
     |   val by = 2
     |   i * by
     | }
res5: Array[Int] = Array(2, 10, 6)
```
