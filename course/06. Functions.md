# 6. Functions

You have learned how to make a computation and how to store the result of a computation in a value or a variable. Now you will learn how to **store a computation**, not the result of a computation but the **expression of a computation**.

> :raising_hand: What is the difference between storing a the **result of a computation** and storing the **expression of a computation**?

Let's say the price of the course is now mutable (is a `var`) and we want to calculate the price including tax:
```scala
scala> var coursePrice = 5
coursePrice: Int = 5

scala> val tax = 0.20
coursePrice: Double = 0.2

scala> val priceTaxIncluded = coursePrice * (1 + taxRate)
priceTaxIncluded: Double = 6.0
```
All good. And now let's modify the price of the course and call again `priceTaxIncluded` to have the new price with tax included:
```scala
scala> coursePrice = 10
coursePrice: Int = 10

scala> priceTaxIncluded
res0: Double = 6.0
```

> :raising_hand: But why `priceTaxIncluded` still returns the old value? Should I make it `var` too?

Making it a `var` will not change anything. What is actually happening is `priceTaxIncluded` gets evaluated at the declaration and only its result gets saved in the `val` (or `var` if it was a variable).  
That is why we will now learn **functions**, to store the **expression of a computation** and not the result!  
We can create a function by writing:
```scala
def NAME: TYPE = EXPRESSION
```
* `def` is the **key word** of the language that corresponds to a **function**.
* *NAME* is the **name** that we want to give to our function, just like values and variables.
* *TYPE* is the **type** of the values returned by the function (`Int`, `Boolean`, `String`...). The type is optional for functions too.
* *EXPRESSION* is the computation that will be executed when we call this function.
As you can see declaring a **function** is not very different from declaring a value or a variable :blush:, it's just that in a function the expression will **not be evaluated at the declaration but everytime you call it**.

Let's try a **function** to calculate the price tax included with a mutable price of course:
```scala
scala> var coursePrice = 5
coursePrice: Int = 5

scala> val tax = 0.20
coursePrice: Double = 0.2

scala> def priceTaxIncluded = coursePrice * (1 + taxRate)
priceTaxIncluded: Double
```
You can notice that it displays the name and the inferred type but **not the result** as it's not evaluated yet.  
Let's try to evaluate `priceTaxIncluded`, modify the price of the course and re-evaluate `priceTaxIncluded`:
```scala
scala> priceTaxIncluded
res0: Double = 6.0

scala> coursePrice = 10
coursePrice: Int = 10

scala> priceTaxIncluded
res1: Double = 12.0
```
Great success!

> :raising_hand: How do I know if I should use a **value** or a **functions**?

It's very simple, you can follow these 2 rules:
* **properties** are represented by values (name, age, length, tax rate...).
* **actions** are represented by functions (jump, greet, priceTaxIncluded may be confusing though and should probably be renamed to something like calculatePriceTaxIncluded...).

Moreover, we prefer to name functions by verbs and values by names to distinguish easily a property from an action.

## Parameters

Now that you know how to declare a function, remember what said your Math teacher far far long time ago about what is a function. What! you where not listening?  
> :information_source: He said a function is something that generates **outputs** according to the **inputs**:  
> ![Function](images/function.png)

A bit like a factory, you give in input plastic, metal, tissue and you get in output a brand new car :car:.

> :raising_hand: But how can I do the same in Scala?

Functions can actually have **inputs**! We put them after the name of the function and between brackets, here is the syntax:
```scala
def NAME(PARAMETER_NAME1: PARAMETER_TYPE1, PARAMETER_NAME2: PARAMETER_TYPE2): TYPE = EXPRESSION
```
In this syntax there is 2 parameters but you can have as many parameter as you want (1, 10 or 5...).  
Let's try this out:
```scala
scala> def greeting(name: String) = "Hello " + name
greeting: (name: String)String

scala> greeting("Joan")
res2: String = Hello Joan
```
A program that greets you, isn't it nice? You are very close to make a robot :wink:

## Default parameters

In Scala it is possible to have default parameters, so that if you give nothing, it will take the default one:
```scala
scala> def greeting(name: String = "Anonymous") = "Hello " + name
greeting: (name: String)String

scala> greeting()
res0: String = Hello Anonymous
```

> :information_source: You can see that the brackets are required.

It is possible to have parameters with defaults and no defaults in the same function, but the ones with defaults will need to be at the end:
```scala
scala> def greeting(greet: String, name: String = "Anonymous") = greet + " " + name
greeting: (greet: String, name: String)String

scala> greeting("Bonjour")
res1: String = Bonjour Anonymous
```

## Higher Order Functions

You saw that we can give **parameters** to functions, particularly **values**. But we can also give **functions**!  
Let's say you want to write a function that returns a `String` containing the course with titles formatted.
So we can define a function that formats a title with 3 `=` around it:
```scala
scala> def simpleTitle(title: String) = "\n===" + title + "===\n"
simpleTitle: (title: String)String
```

Then define the function that returns the course formatted (which makes use of the previous function):
```scala
scala> def course =
     |   simpleTitle("Default parameters") +
     |     "Now we will learn Default parameters\n" +
     |     simpleTitle("Higher Order Functions") +
     |     "Now we will learn Higher Order Functions"
course: String
```

Now we can get the course with titles formatted:
```scala
scala> course
res0: String =
=== Default parameters ===
Now we will learn Default parameters

=== Higher Order Functions ===
Now we will learn Higher Order Functions
```

But what if you want the titles formatted differently depending on where you call `course` (yes some people might like the titles in a certain style and some in an other :smiley:)?  
A solution is to pass the **function** that formats titles **as a parameter**. We call them "**Higher Order Functions**" and here is how to define `course` with this parameter:
```scala
scala> def course(title: String => String) =
     |   title("Default parameters") +
     |     "Now we will learn Default parameters\n" +
     |     title("Higher Order Functions") +
     |     "Now we will learn Higher Order Functions"
course: (title: String => String)String
```
* The type `String => String` is a **function** that takes a `String` and return a `String`.
* We can call the given function `title` just like other functions or values.

Now let's try this giving `simpleTitle` as a parameter:
```scala
scala> course(simpleTitle)
res0: String =
=== Default parameters ===
Now we will learn Default parameters

=== Higher Order Functions ===
Now we will learn Higher Order Functions
```

> :raising_hand: Why would I give the function in parameter? Why don't I call it directly from inside the `course` function?

Because if you want you could change the way you want to format titles by giving a different function in parameter!

Often we don't want to define a function before giving it as a parameter. So it is possible to give an **anonymous function** to redefine the format of titles:
```scala
course((title: String) => "\n---" + title + "---\n")
res1: String =
--- Default parameters ---
Now we will learn Default parameters

--- Higher Order Functions ---
Now we will learn Higher Order Functions
```

Don't be afraid that's very simple, you just need to take off the `def simpleTitle` and add a `>` after the `=` to make an arrow:
```scala
def simpleTitle(title: Int) = "\n---" + title + "---\n"  
               (title: Int) => "\n---" + title + "---\n"
```
And now we have titles with `-` around it!

> :raising_hand: And what if I want to write multiple lines in an an **anonymous function**?

In Scala you can turn brackets of function's parameter (only if there is one parameter) into curly brackets which let's you write multiple lines:
```scala
course { (title: String) =>
  val dashs = "---"
  "\n" + dashs + title + dashs + "\n"
}
```

## Exercises

#### Exercise 1
Remember in the [exercise 2 of the chapter 3. Values](solutions/03. Values/Exercise 2.md) we where computing the price including tax.  
It would be much proper if we had a function that takes a **price** and return the **price with the tax included**.

1. Write the **[signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_signature)** of this function. A signature is the part of the function that is before the `=` sign, it shows how to use the function. [:scroll: Solution](solutions/06. Functions/Exercise 1.1.md)
2. Write the **whole function** with it's implementation. [:scroll: Solution](solutions/06. Functions/Exercise 1.2.md)

#### Exercise 2
In the Exercise 1 we made a function that calculate the price tax included from a price.  
Now we want a function that takes a **price** and gives us a **receipt** (a String) with both the **price** and the **total with tax**, using the function we made in the Exercice 1.

1. Write the **signatures** of this function. [:scroll: Solution](solutions/06. Functions/Exercise 2.1.md)
2. Write the **whole function** with it's implementation. [:scroll: Solution](solutions/06. Functions/Exercise 2.2.md)


#### Exercise 3
In the Exercise 2 we made a function that gives us a receipt with the price and the total with tax, using the function we made in the Exercise 1 that calculate the price with tax.  
There is a problem with this solution if we want to give a different receipt for each country. Every country don't have the same tax rate and here we always call the same function that have a fixed tax rate!  
One solution is to pass the **function** that calculates the tax, as a **parameter** to the receipt function ([Higher Order Function](#higher-order-functions)), so that we can give the tax calculator that correspond to the right country.

1. Write the **signatures** of this function. [:scroll: Solution](solutions/06. Functions/Exercise 3.1.md)
2. Write the **whole function** with it's implementation. [:scroll: Solution](solutions/06. Functions/Exercise 3.2.md)
