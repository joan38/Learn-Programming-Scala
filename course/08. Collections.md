# 8. Collections

You are not aware but you already know what is a collection :hushed:. I can even tell you that you used them multiple times :flushed:.  
`String`s are actually collections of `Char`s! So let's try some collection operation on a `String`:  
We can access the `n`th element of a collection with the `apply(Int)` function (remember that we can call `apply` without giving it's name):
```scala
risk> val myString = "Hello"
myString: String = Hello

risk> myString(0)
res27: Char = H

risk> myString(2)
res28: Char = l
```

> :raising_hand: What if I call `apply(Int)` with an index that doesn't exist?

Try it:
```scala
risk> myString(5)
java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 5
```
You will get an exception. An exception is like an error message that will crash your application.

## Array

Here is another type of collection: `Array`. The advantage of `Array`s is that they are not limited to `Char`s and can contain any type. Here is an example with integers:
```scala
scala> val numbers = Array(1, 5, 3)
numbers: Array[Int] = Array(1, 5, 3)
```
Notice the type is `Array[Int]`, this is called a **parameterized type** and we say that it's an `Array` of `Int`. That means it can only contains `Int`s.

We can do the same collection operations as `String`s, like getting the `n`th value:
```scala
scala> numbers(1)
res1: Int = 5
```

With a collection of numbers (`Int` or `Double`) we can sum all:
```scala
scala> numbers.sum
res2: Int = 9
```

You can try with another type like `String`:
```scala
scala> val strings = Array("Hey", "you", "!")
strings: Array[String] = Array(Hey, you, !)
```

> :raising_hand: Isn't it a collection of collection?

Yes it is and there is no issue about nesting collections.

## Range

A `Range` is yet another type of collection that is specialized in ranges from `n` to `m`. An example would better illustrate that:
```scala
scala> 0 to 5
res0: scala.collection.immutable.Range.Inclusive = Range(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```
> :information_source: The type here is a little bit longer than what we've seen until now for some raison we will see in future chapters.

You can see that it creates a `Range` with all the values from `0` to `5` included.

It is possible to create a none inclusive range of the upperbound:
```scala
scala> 0 until 5
res0: scala.collection.immutable.Range = Range(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
```

## Map

`Map` is another type of collection that stores **keys** mapped to **values**:
```scala
scala> val myMap = Map("Joan" -> 26, "Jack" -> 30)
myMap: scala.collection.immutable.Map[String,Int] = Map(Joan -> 26, Jack -> 30)
```
This `Map` contains `String`s as keys that represent the name of some people, and for each key a `Int` that represents there age.

Let's use it now. We want to know the age of Jack:
```scala
scala> myMap("Jack")
res0: Int = 30
```
Jack is 30.

If you try with a key that doesn't exist you will get an exception (an exception is like an error message that will crash your application):
```scala
scala> myMap("Paul")
java.util.NoSuchElementException: key not found: Paul
```

## Concatenate, Add, Remove

### Concatenate

It is possible to **concatenate** 2 collection with `++`:
```scala
scala> val myArray1 = Array(1, 3)
myArray1: Array[Int] = Array(1, 3)

scala> val myArray2 = Array(45, 2)
myArray2: Array[Int] = Array(45, 2)

scala> myArray1 ++ myArray2
res0: Array[Int] = Array(1, 3, 45, 2)
```

It also works for `Map`s:
```scala
scala> val myMap1 = Map("Joan" -> 26, "Jack" -> 30)
myMap1: scala.collection.immutable.Map[String,Int] = Map(Joan -> 26, Jack -> 30)

scala> val myMap2 = Map("Joan" -> 27, "Oliver" -> 20)
myMap2: scala.collection.immutable.Map[String,Int] = Map(Joan -> 27, Oliver -> 20)

scala> myMap1 ++ myMap2
res1: scala.collection.immutable.Map[String,Int] = Map(Joan -> 27, Jack -> 30, Oliver -> 20)
```
And as you can see if there is **overlaping** keys in both `Map`s the ones in **the last** `Map` are retained, as they replace the ones in the previous `Map`.

### Add

It is possible to **append** something to an `Array` with the function `:+`:
```scala
scala> val myArray = Array(1, 3)
myArray: Array[Int] = Array(1, 3)

scala> myArray :+ 2
res0: Array[Int] = Array(1, 3, 2)

scala> myArray
res1: Array[Int] = Array(1, 3)
```

> :raising_hand: Hey why when I call `myArray` again I don't get it with the new element appened?

Because collections in Scala are **immutable** :hushed:. Everytime you modify a collection the modifying function (for example `:+`) will return a new collection with the change in it.

> :raising_hand: Why don't we use **mutable** collections?

For the same reason as `var`. When ever we have mutability, we are exposed to more bugs.  
So you can do like that:
```scala
scala> val myArray = Array(1, 3)
myArray: Array[Int] = Array(1, 3)

scala> val myNewArray = myArray :+ 2
myNewArray: Array[Int] = Array(1, 3, 2)

scala> myNewArray
res1: Array[Int] = Array(1, 3, 2)
```

It is also possible to **prepend** an element with `+:`:
```scala
scala> val myNewArray2 = 2 +: myArray
myNewArray2: Array[Int] = Array(2, 1, 3)
```
Notice that the colons (`:`) are always oriented to the `Array`.

To **add** a key/value to a `Map` as there is not notion of appenning or prepending, so we just use the function `+`:
```scala
scala> val myMap = Map("Joan" -> 26, "Jack" -> 30)
myMap: scala.collection.immutable.Map[String,Int] = Map(Joan -> 26, Jack -> 30)

scala> val myNewMap = myArray + ("Oliver" -> 20)
myNewMap: scala.collection.immutable.Map[String,Int] = Map(Joan -> 26, Jack -> 30, "Oliver" -> 20)
```

If you add a key that **already exist**, it will **replace** the value with the one provided:
```scala
scala> val myNewMap2 = myArray + ("Joan" -> 27)
myNewMap2: Array[Int] = scala.collection.immutable.Map[String,Int] = Map(Joan -> 27, Jack -> 30)
```

### Remove

You can **drop** the `n` first elements of an `Array` with `myArray.drop(n)` and the `n` last with `myArray.dropRight(Int)`.  
You can **take** the `n` first elements of an `Array` with `myArray.take(n)` and the `n` last with `myArray.takeRight(Int)`.  
So you can **remove** the `n`th element of an `Array` with `myArray.take(n) ++ myArray.drop(n)`.  
You can **remove** a key from a `Map` with `myMap - "Joan"`.

> :raising_hand: Why do we need to do that complicated `myArray.take(n) ++ myArray.drop(n)` to remove the `n`th element? Why don't we have something like `myArray.remove(n)` ?

Because in practice we don't remove an element based on the position of an element in the `Array`. We usually remove an element based on what is this element instead of it's position.  
Let's say you want to remove the `2` of the `Array`, I can use `filter`:
```scala
scala> val myArray = Array(1, 3, 2)
myArray: Array[Int] = Array(1, 3, 2)

scala> val myNewArray = myArray.filter((i: Int) => i != 2)
myNewArray: Array[Int] = Array(1, 3)
```
