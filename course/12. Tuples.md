# 12. Tuples

Let's learn something very simple to understand (and simple for me to explain) this time.  
You know how to write a function that returns a value, but you can actually return only one value from that function, and I think it's time to learn about Tuples to fix this issue.

How to write a Tuple:
```scala
scala> (3, 7)
res0: (Int, Int) = (3,7)
```

You can also have different types in a Tuple:
```scala
scala> (3, "Yes")
res1: (Int, String) = (3,Yes)
```

You can have Tuples of as many elements as you want:
```scala
scala> (3, "Yes", 3.4, 'u')
res1: (Int, String, Double, Char) = (3,Yes,3.4,u)
```

So you can return it from a function:
```scala
scala> def tupleFunk = {
     |   val one = 2 + 3
     |   val two = "Yes" + "No"
     |   (one, two)
     | }
tupleFunk: (Int, String)
```

From a value:
```scala
scala> val tupleVal = {
     |   val one = 2 + 3
     |   val two = "Yes" + "No"
     |   (one, two)
     | }
tupleVal: (Int, String) = (5,YesNo)
```

In collections:
```scala
scala> Array(("Paris", 10), ("London", 20), ("New York", 5))
res2: Array[(String, Int)] = Array((Paris,10), (London,20), (New York,5))

scala> Map("BMW" -> ("Very Good", 80), "Renault" -> ("Good", 60), "Tata" -> ("WTF", 5))
res3: scala.collection.immutable.Map[String,(String, Int)] = Map(BMW -> (Very Good,80), Renault -> (Good,60), Tata -> (WTF,5))
```
Everywhere.
