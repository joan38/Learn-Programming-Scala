# 13. Packages

You had growing numbers of functions in your application and we had a solution to organise them. We now write them in objects.  
But what about the growing number of objects?

> :raising_hand: We can organise them the same way we do for our files, in **folders**!

Ok let's do this, but before mind the fact that SBT will not look in any folders to compile your Scala files. It will look first in `src/main/scala` and it doesn't exist it looks in the current project folder.  
So until now we used the current project folder but we should really use `src/main/scala` as it looks tidy and it allows us to use packages to tidy even more.

> :raising_hand: But why this long path `src/main/scala`?

* `src` stands for source. It the folder that will contains all the source files to compile.
* `main` is where your application lives. We will have `test` in the future, that will contain the tests for the application.
* `scala` because it is possible to have application written in multiple programming languages.

Let's create this folder:

> :information_source: Note that in Idea you can write a path and it will create all the folders for you (see picture below)

![New Directory](images/IdeaNewDirectory.png)  
You can see the folder `scala` is in blue, that means it's a source folder where SBT will look for files to compile.  
![src Folder](images/IdeaSrcFolder.png)  

Now that we are ready to organise our objects in folders, let's create the package `com.github.joan38.scalacourse`.

> :raising_hand: Why do you speak about "package" now? And why do you write packages with dots?

In Scala we don't speak about folders but about packages. The differences are that we don't use slashes (`/` or `\`) to represent a package path but dots (`.`).  
So `com.github.joan38.scalacourse` on the disk correspond to the folders `src/main/scala/com/github/joan38/scalacourse`.

Once we create or move objects in a package we also need to specify the package where this object belongs to at the top of the file.  
The way to specify it is:
```scala
package PACKAGE
```
* `package` is the **keyword** to specify a package.
* *PACKAGE* is the **path** package we saw earlier: `com.github.joan38.scalacourse`.

So our Scala file should be:
```scala
package com.github.joan38.scalacourse

object MyObject {
  def myFunction = "Hello"
}
```

## Terminology

Again for packages too developers agreed on conventions:
* Only **lowercase** letters, no symbols, no uppercase letters.
* Any package should be **unique** in the world to avoid confusion if you merge packages between apps, therefore the begining of a package should start with your domain name reversed. For example if I am Microsoft, I have the domaine name `microsoft.com`, then my packages starts with `com.microsoft`.
  
  > :raising_hand: What if I don't have any domain name?

  Then you can just call your package the name of your app and don't worry about this rule. In our case we used `com.github.joan38.scalacourse` beacause I host this course on `github.com/joan38`.

## Imports

Another specificity of packages is that when you want to refer to an object from a different package you need to give the whole package path:
```scala
package com.github.joan38.scalacourse.mypackage

object MyObject {
  def myFunction = "I am MyObject.myFunction from the package com.github.joan38.scalacourse.mypackage"
}
```
`myFunction` lives in the object `MyObject`, which lives in the package `com.github.joan38.scalacourse.mypackage`.  
Now in the package `com.github.joan38.scalacourse`:
```scala
package com.github.joan38.scalacourse

object MyApplication {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println(com.github.joan38.scalacourse.mypackage.MyObject.myFunction)
  }
}
```
So to access `myFunction` in the `main` of `MyApplication` we need to write the whole path `com.github.joan38.scalacourse.mypackage.MyObject.myFunction` because I am not in the same package.

> :raising_hand: But this is long and tidious :worried:!

Yes it is, that's why we have imports which let us import the content of a package.  
Here is how we write an import:
```scala
import PACKAGE
```
* `import` is the **keyword** 
* *PACKAGE* is the path package, for example `com.github.joan38.scalacourse.mypackage`.

So we can then write `MyApplication` this way:
```scala
package com.github.joan38.scalacourse

import com.github.joan38.scalacourse.mypackage.MyObject

object MyApplication {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println(MyObject.myFunction)
  }
}
```

It is possible to import everything is package with the underscore (`_`) wildcard:
```scala
package com.github.joan38.scalacourse

import com.github.joan38.scalacourse.mypackage._

object MyApplication {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println(MyObject.myFunction)
  }
}
```
It will now import all objects in this package.

You can even import the content of an object:
```scala
package com.github.joan38.scalacourse

import com.github.joan38.scalacourse.mypackage.MyObject._

object MyApplication {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println(myFunction)
  }
}
```
