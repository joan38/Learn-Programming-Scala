## Introduction

> :raising_hand: What is this?

This is a **course**, but not a course to learn Scala! It is a course to **learn programming**... indeed with Scala.  
So the target audience is people who don't know how to code and/or don't know how applications are made but have an interest in at least understanding how that "magic" works without necessarily willing to be a programmer.

I wrote this course because my girlfriend who is from a history of art background wanted to understand a little of what I'm doing everyday at work. So the chalenge is double as she doesn't understand anything about computers, plus she doesn't have a vocation to be a developer. All that to say if she can understand, you can understand (she is not idiot hein!).

> :raising_hand: Scala for a beginner!? Isn't it too hard for a first language?

Why would you think that? If Scala is hard to learn then Java is even more.  
Scala as a very simple and unified syntax easy to learn and have a REPL (console) where you can try code without creating a whole application. It also have the functionnal oriented aspect that is easier to learn than the object oriented.  
Indeed there is more functionallity in Scala that makes more things to learn but as a beginner you don't need to learn all of them.

> :raising_hand: What si special about this course? There are tons of them on the web.

* Scala for beginners, not switchers from another language.
* [Functional oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) first and [Object oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) second.
* Learn how to make an application as quickly as possible, sacrificing anything that's not key to that goal.
* No assumptions, all is explained.
